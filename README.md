# Image-Classification-with-cnn-using-keras


This project uses `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` in  `Keras` with a `TensorFlow` backend, and you will learn to train CNNs to solve Image Classification problems. In this project uses a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.

This is used to classify  3 classes : aeroplane ðŸ›« , car  ðŸš— and bird ðŸ•Š (Beginers project)
